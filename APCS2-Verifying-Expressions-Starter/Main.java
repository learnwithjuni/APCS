    // 0. Define a double variable called forty with value 40.0


    // 1. Define a variable called one and set it equal to the value: forty == 20
    
    // System.out.println(one);
    // What does the above line output? Answer here before uncommenting and running the line of code to verify your guess.


    // 2. Define variable called two and set it equal to the value: 35 <= forty
    
    // System.out.println(two);
    // What does the above line output? Answer here before uncommenting and running the line of code to verify your guess.


    // 3. Define variable called three and set it equal to the value: (int) forty

    // System.out.println(three);
    // What does the above line output? Answer here before uncommenting and running the line of code to verify your guess.


    // 4. Define variable called four and set it equal to the value: three == forty
    
    // System.out.println(four);
    // What does the above line output? Answer here before uncommenting and running the line of code to verify your guess.


    // 5. Define a double variable called five and set it equal to the value: 35.5
    // Define an integer variable called six and set it equal to the value: (int) five
    // Define a boolean variable seven and set it equal to the value: five == six
    
    // System.out.println(seven);
    // What does the above line output? Answer here before uncommenting and running the line of code to verify your guess.


    // 6. Define a variable called eight and set it equal to the value: (boolean) seven
    
    // System.out.println(eight);
    // What does the above line output? Answer here before uncommenting and running the line of code to verify your guess


    // 7. Define a variable called nine and set it equal to the value: eight == seven
    
    // System.out.println(nine);
    // What does the above line output? Answer here before uncommenting and running the line of code to verify your guess.
