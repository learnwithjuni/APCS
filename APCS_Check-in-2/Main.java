    //Question 8: Have the student discuss the role of the class in interacting with a specific object.
    // Ans: the class is the blueprint for our instance of the class, which is an object tester.

      Classes two!

    // Discuss the pros and cons of public versus private access in code.
    // Ans: easy to access public variables without methods, but anyone (users without knowledge of function) can change them directly and potentially break the object.

    //question two in Time.java
    //ans: in order: 2, 3, 2, 2

    //  Have the student explain what this refers to and why it can be necessary in the constructor.
    // Ans: this refers to the object we are within. In the constructor we use this to differentiate between arguments and instance variables which may have the same name.

    // Have the student explain a situation in which a static class is the correct decision.
    // ex. interstRate for a Bank, which is the same for all users.

    // Have the student explain a situation in which method overloading is a reasonable decision.
    // ex: If there is a default behavior of the method and a more specific behavior that the user can decide between.
